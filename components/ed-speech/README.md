## Support

The [Speech Recognition API](https://caniuse.com/speech-recognition) is only available in Chrome and Safari, your data is sent to server to do the text to speech task.


## Usage

```html
<ed-speech lang="en" answer="Hello">
  Say «Hello».
</ed-speech>
```

As in every ed-component, you can use Markdown as content.

```html
<ed-speech type="rating">
  Say **heat** and not _it_.
</ed-speech>
```
