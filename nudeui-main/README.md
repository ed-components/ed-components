# Nude UI

A collection of accessible, customizable, ultra-light web components

- Using built-in controls whenever possible, web components when JS and/or extra elements are needed
- Highly customizable
- Tiny (most are ~1KB minified & compressed)

A work in progress. Try them out and [provide feedback](https://github.com/leaverou/nudeui) or move along and check back later.

## Wanna use them all?

This includes all components from the two categories above (existing and in progress).

import "https://nudeui.com/index.js";
```

## Failed experiments

Do not use. These have serious flaws and are likely incomplete.
They are included here only in case someone else wants to look into fixing their issues,
as well as a warning for other wanderers going down the same path.
