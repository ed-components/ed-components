## White book

ed-components are implemented as web-components(using lit) and can be used in
the client-side without any server.

A configurable demo is provided for teachers that do not want to install
anything. Fill a form and submit it to get a shareable url with the form data
encoded in the url.

ed-components emit events in order to be used in server apps.

ed-components can be exported to various formats using [pandoc]()

An open-source library of contents is published as a git repo.
